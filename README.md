Other types of media are NOT supported, such as : mp3, wav, etcâ€¦ or need to be converted to uncompressed raw data. If the result is empty, your request data must be in wrong format in most case. Encoded base64 string of byte[] that generated from raw data less than 500KB (3-5 seconds sample are good enough for detection) will be sent via body as plain text
